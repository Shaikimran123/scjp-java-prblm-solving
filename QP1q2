public class Jail { 
private int x = 4; 
public static void main(String[] args) { 
protected int x = 6;   //Illegal modifier for parameter x; only final is permitted

}
Which are true? (Choose all that apply.)
A. Compilation succeeds.
B. The output is "throw away key 4".
C. The output is "throw away key 6".
D. Compilation fails due to an error on line 5.
E. Compilation fails due to an error on line 6.
F. Compilation fails due to an error on line 9.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Line 4 is declaring local variable "x", and local variables cannot have access 
modifiers. If line 4 read "int x = 6", the code would compile and the result would be 
"throw away key 4". Line54 creates an anonymous Jail object, an anonymous Cell 
object, and invokes slam(). Inner classes have access to their enclosing classâ€™s private
variables.
